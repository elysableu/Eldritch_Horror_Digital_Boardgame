The World is Devoured! *
Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions tear the Earth's crust apart at a rate faster than the devastation can be recorded or comprehended. As the planet's atmosphere grows increasingly toxic, the insects of Shaggai return to their ships and teleport away, anxious to doom a different world. Eventually, when every living thing on the planet has been reduced to a cinder, a new Outer God emerges from the ruins and joins Azathoth's court at the center of all things. *
Investigators lose the game. *
