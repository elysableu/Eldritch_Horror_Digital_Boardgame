Final Mystery *
The feral mother of all monstrosities has manifested! She is an enormous cloud from which dozens of tentacles extend and retract. Wherever she goes, she leaves behind large hoof prints. To behold her true, terrifying form is to come face to face with true, primal horror. *
When the Shub-Niggurath Epic Monster is defeated, the Final Mystery is solved and investigators win the game. *
