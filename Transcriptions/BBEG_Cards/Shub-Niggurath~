Shub-Niggurath *
The Black Goat of the Woods *
Spawn 1 Monster on a random space. Then, if there are 10 or more Monsters on the game board, advance Doom by 2. *
When 3 Mysteries have been solved, investigators win the game. *
When Shub-Niggurath awakens, flip this sheet and resolve the "Shub-Niggurath Awakens!" effect on the back. *
During pagan rites, Shub-Niggurath absorbs worthy cultists into her amorphous body and tranforms them into gof'nn hupadgh Shub-Niggurath, the goat spawn. From the wildest corners of the earth, her primal brood, the dark young, emerge to overwhelm humanity. *
