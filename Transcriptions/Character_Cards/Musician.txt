Old Jim Culver's music gives sweet comfort to the soul, and it doesn't matter if that soul belongs to the living or the dead. Folks in their graves, they love their little chats with Jim. It used to bother him, but now he's happy for the company. Lately, some departed souls in San Antonio have been all riled up about something. They're downright terrified. And anything that scares that dead deserces old Jim's undivided attention. *
Seeing Jim in this hospital bed is heartbreaking. He hands you a key to a safety deposit box. Gain all of his possessions. The severity of the injuries means that he'll never speak or play music again. You gently try to coax him into writing down everything he's learned ({}). *
If you pass, Jim fills a dozen sheets of paper with arcane illustrations; retreat Doom by 1. *
If you fail, all Jim wants is to listen to a record of his own music played over and over. *
Whether you pass or not, discard his Investigator token. *
At the cemetery's gate, you find Jim's old suitcase and hear wild and erratic music ahead. Gain all of his possessions. Summoning all your nerve, you walk toward the crowd of dancing cadavers that surround Jim ({}). *
If you pass, you spend the night learning the secrets of the dead; retreat Doom by 1. *
If you faill, you run, and Jim is never seen by a living soul again. *
Whether you pass or not, discard his Investigator token. *
