Around the world, Lola has performed dramatic roles for sold-out houses. However, after being cast in the controversial play, The King in Yellow, Lola needed to "take some time" to recover from her "exhaustion." Now that she has checked herslef out of the asylum, she's ready for her big comeback. But this time she'll play a different role in the fight against the horrors that threaten this world. She's started by traveling to Tokyo to track down the only other surviving cast member of her previous theatrical endeavor. *
"I'm fine, darling. Help yourself, by the way." Lola nods at the equipment
strewn across the hotel room. Gain all of her possessions. As convincing as
she is, you know she's in pain. You try to persuade her to visit a hospital
({INFLUENCE}). *
If you pass, she sighs a breath of relief and tells you of all the horrors she's encountered; retreat the Doom by 1. *
If you fail, the day after Lola leaves the city, she succumbs to her wounds. *
Whether you pass or not, discard her Investigator token. *
The trail of Lola's belongings lead you into a derelict theater. Gain all of
her possessions. She's on the stage wringing her blood-soaked hands and
reciting, "Will these hands ne'er be clean?" You try to direct her
performance, hoping to better reveal her character ({INFLUENCE}). *
If you pass, she tells you of the Tattered King, indicating a goat she's killed; retreate Doom by 1. *
If you fail, Lola's dialogue degenerates into gibberish. *
Whether you pass or not, discard her Investigator token. *
