Everyone expected great things from Trish when she was young. In school, she excelled in athletics and the sciences, but she surprised everyone after graduation by settling into a humble position at a commercial code company.

Now she finds herself in the city of Krasnoyarsk meeting another agent who has important information about an impending threat from a world beyond our own. *
